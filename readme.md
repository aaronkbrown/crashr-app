# Crashr

Crashr is an app that was built during a recent Startup Weekend event whose purpose is to scrape Facebook for nearby social events based on geolocation and randomly select an event with information to display on the browser. The user can then RSVP or decline the event by clicking on a set of icons. Currently the app references a static JSON file for demonstration purposes.

This app is designed to run on PhoneGap in order to operate on mobile devices. It was originally built on legacy code from a previous project and so the front end code has been refactored to remove table layouts and enforce a better separation between content and presentation.
